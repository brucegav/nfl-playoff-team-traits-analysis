    "# PHASE 1: PER PLAY SUCCESS AND TRAITS THAT DEFINE IT\n",
    "\n",
    "## OBJECTIVE\n",
    "To build a foundational machine learning model capable of predicting the probability of success (positive EPA) for any given NFL play before the ball is snapped. By using play-by-play data, player participation, FTN charting, and Next Gen Stats from postseason games (2016-2024), we will establish a baseline for how difficult any given game situation is.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## METHODOLOGY\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**: Constructing 70+ pre-snap signals to capture the context of the play. This includes situational variables (down, distance, time, score), scheme elements (motion, defensive box count), and personnel metrics (QB efficiency, receiver strength).\n",
    "2. **XGBoost Machine Learning**: Training an extreme gradient boosting classifier to handle the complex, non-linear interactions between these pre-snap features and the ultimate success of the play.\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying and isolating the most critical signals, ensuring we remove any \"leaky\" post-snap features (like `play_type`) to force the model to learn true situational execution.\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Calibrating the model to ensure our output probabilities (xSuccess) are highly accurate, conservative, and reliable for the downstream team-level aggregation we will perform in Phase 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The model scored with an accuracy ~58% which is solid for a baseline model with barebones features.\n",
    "2. The model values passing plays more than running plays in regards to play success.  This is most likely due to passing plays typically resulting in more net yardage than running plays in the aggregate.  Though, this misses crucial game context.  An overall successful run allows an offense to make the defense focus more on the running game, which opens up more opportunities for successful passing plays, it allows for more time of possession for the offense, it also allows an offense leading late in the game to chew more time off the clock without giving the trailing team opportunities to mount a comeback.  Engineering features to provide the model with this context is key.  Proposed features to add this training context:\n",
    "   - cummalative_run_yards: total rushing yards in the game so far.  The model can see if the defense is being worn down by the run and how it may begin to cheat up with its backers to stop it\n",
    "   - time_of_possession_diff: is there a significant disparity in time of possession and is success in the running game contributing to that\n",
    "   - total_score: to give the model important context on the game score and provide context on team motivation\n",
    "   - posteam_type: provides 'home' and 'away' data to see if the model can determine a homefield advantage, which is typically weighted heavily in game predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The field surface does not seem to have any relevant correlation to success or failure\n",
    "- stadium type (indoor vs outdoor) does not seem to have significant affect on success\n",
    "- colder temp does seem to affect play success in that the colder the environment, the greater the chance of play failure\n",
    "- game time remaining has great importance in game result.  More time remaining leads to high chances of a successful result.\n",
    "- The most impactful feature is ydstogo.  The lower the yards to go, the greater chance of successful result.  This is common sense, but proves the model is making realistic predictions based on its training data."

    "## FEATURE ENGINEERING ROUND 2: BUILD FEATURES TO CAPTURE PLAYER TALENT\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build features that give the model appropriate context on player talent without injecting unnecessary bias into its training, we need a metric that not only properly accesses player value to the team's performance but is from an appropriate historical timeframe.  For this we will use the the average EPA of the player from the regular season associated with the postseason the game occurred in.  For example, we would use Patrick Mahomes average passer EPA from 2023 for the Chiefs 2023 playoff games.  In doing this, the model is only given the value metric for that player for the preceding regular season and is not biased by future or further past performance.  It is only given the most relevant/recent context.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. avg_qb_epa: average passing epa of the quarterback for the preceding regular season\n",
    "2. avg_rush_epa: average rush epa of the runner for the preceding regular season\n",
    "3. avg_target_epa: average target epa of the top 3 receivers for the team for the preceding regular season\n",
    "4. avg_def_epa: average defensive epa of the team defense for the preceding regular season\n",
    "\n",
    "Each metric is also tied to the player_id of the player in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **feature injection** approach will be used to map the appropriate epa value to the corresponding play.  In order for the individual player value to be given for each play, the player's average epa value must be given to the model for each play that player is involved in.  However, simply adding the player_ids to the data will not work because then the model will train on that data (which is irrelevant to the goal analysis).  To avoid directly including this player identifying data, we will load the player_id data from playoff_master into a temporary dataframe, then map the specific player epa data to each player_id from playoff_master.  Then create a function to pull the necessary data for each play which results in the correct epa values being added to model_df for each play.  Then the model will be provided the appropriate player skill context that contributed the play's outcome."

    "## OBSERVATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dominance of Passing Talent**: 'avg_rec_epa' is the single most important feature in the model.  The confirms that the model highly values an elite passing game, and more directly an elite receiving corps as the primary driver of play success.\n",
    "- **Context Still Key**:  'play_type_run' and 'possession_seconds' remain in the top 3 of feature importance.  This confirms that while talent is of importance, the specific strategic context and game control are still critical foundational elements that drive play success\n",
    "- **Rushing vs Passing**:  'avg_rec_epa' is valued far higher than 'avg_rush_epa' by the model.  This intuitively makes sense since passing plays typically result in higher yardage gains than runs.  However, the current structure of the features is not providing the model with enough context about an effective run game in the broader context of gameplay.  A strong run game allows a team to control possession more, forces the defense to cheat for the run, opening up the passing game, and also tires the defense out later in the game.  Features will have to be added to provide this context\n",
    "- **QB vs Target Value**:  The model currently values the production of the receivers highly over the production over the QB.  This goees against common NFL knowledge where the talent of the QB is viewed as far more important to team success than the talent of the receivers.  This warrants investigation\n",

    "### OBSERVATIONS\n",
    "- **Irrelevant Context Metrics:** The new scoring context metrics (is_redzone, is_goal_to_go, is_fg_range) appear to be irrelevant to the model and do not appear in the Feature Importance plot. This is likely due to the spike in yards_to_goal_diff importance; the model derives sufficient scoring potential information from that single metric. We will drop these three flags from the feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Receiver vs. QB Value:** A surprising finding is that the model values active_rec_epa (receiver production) significantly higher than active_qb_epa (QB production). This contradicts standard NFL wisdom where the Quarterback is viewed as the primary driver of success. This suggests the model might be over-indexing on the result of passing plays (receivers making plays) rather than the process (QB play), or it implies that elite receiving corps are a stronger differentiator in this specific dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Undervalued Run Game:** avg_rush_epa remains low in importance compared to passing metrics. While passing generally yields more EPA, the current feature set fails to capture the broader strategic value of a strong run game (possession control, wearing down defenses, setting up play-action).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Breaking the Accuracy Wall:** To improve upon the ~68% accuracy plateau and address these context gaps, we will add the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- yards_gained_prev_play: To give the model a sense of immediate momentum and game flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- clutch_index: To differentiate high-pressure 4th quarter decisions from low-leverage 1st quarter plays."

    "- the model continues to highly value active_rec_epa.  I believe this may be because of data leakage.  Plays that are not a pass do not include a active_rec_epa and those that are a pass, do.  Therefore, the model sees a high active_rec_epa on a pass play and is easily able to determine the outcome of the play without viewing the other features.  Essentially, it is cheating on coming to the outcome of successful plays.  Having this feature in the feature set is allowing the model to cheat.  Dropping active_rec_epa, active_rush_epa, and rush_matchup_epa (which all allow the model to guess the play outcome without accessing the other features) should make the feature importance more realistic.  This will also likely decrease model accuracy greatly, but it will provide a more realistic baseline to build upon.\n",

The model needs context to learn this.  Same for early downs vs later downs (1st down vs 3rd down).  This metric will hopefully build that context.\n",

As a team 'gets on a roll' or has repeated success, this tends to lend to future success.  We need to build this context into the model's training.\n",

    "### SHAP SUMMARY INTERPRETATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'ydstogo': when ydstogo is high, the model is correctly predicting likely play failure\n",
    "2. 'number_of_pass_rushers': this appears to be backwards, when the number of pass rushers is low, the chance of play success should increase, not decrease \n",
    "3. 'box_mismatch':  this partially makes sense.  as the differential increases in the offense's favors (when they have more blockers) their success probability decreases.  This makes sense in that when an offense has more blockers on the line, they are typically running, which leads to shorter yardage gains.  Though, it looks like the model may be interpreting this incorrectly.  Either way, it values this feature the least of the ones in the plot.\n",
    "4. active_qb_epa surprisingly does not have the impact it should.  a weaker qb correctly decreases likelihood of play success, but stronger qbs do not seem to move the needle towards succes much.\n",
    "5. team_game_success_rate seems to be interpreted by the model as noise\n",
    "6. 'down': the model seems to be interpreting this correctly.  Higher value in 'down' (3rd or 4th) end in failure more.  lower number in 'down' (1st or 2nd) are slightly more successful and some higher number downs are also successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the model seems to be correctly understanding the situational context of the game.  It struggles to value positions and player talent well.  It very much struggles to understand the team strategy features ('number_of_pass_rushers').  Better features to explain player skill/value are needed, better features to explain team strategy are needed.  I think we may have hit the ceiling with the model as far as situational understanding.  The bulk of the model's predictive accuracy seems to be coming from that, and we will need to increase strength of the other features mentioned in order to increase the overall accuracy"

    "- the model clearly understands situational context and basic rules of the game.  What is does not have, in a properly digestible way, is the information on the people playing the game.  We have tried overly specific features like avg_qb_epa by specific player, but model does not seem to interpret this well or derive any signal from it.  The issue is most likely that the model is not seeing the correlation between the qb's performance and the situation.\n",
    "- Therefore, we need to engineer features that explicitly tell the model how players perform in specific situations and circumstances.  For example, creating a metric (on a scale of 1-100) that grades a QB on how they performed against the blitz in the regular season preceding the playoff game in question.  If the model is given 'num_of_pass_rushers' and 'qb_value_vs_blitz' it can learn, \"this defense is in likely blitz formation, the qb is very good against the blitz, this play is likely to succeed\".  It will learn to derive a signal from the correlation of these two features.  This can be done with performance on certain downs, performance at certain points in the game (time-based), team rushing abilities against certain defense schemes, wide receiver corps performance against certain coverages, etc."

    "The model appears to be well calibrated.  The overwhelming amount of incorrect predictions are those where the model did not appear to have much confidence in its prediction.  Only 12 times did it have a probability of success outside of the 20-80 range and predict the result incorrectly.  And of those 12 times, the biggest misses were on situations where the likelihood for it to be correct seems reasonable.  For example, NO vs PHI the situation is 3rd and 1.  The model was predicted success with 83.5% confidence.  Most would view this as a play with high odds to end in a 1st down.  The play failed.  Another example, MIA vs KC the situation is 4th and 6.  The model predicted failure on this play with a probability of success of 3.7%.  Again, most analysts or viewers would align with this prediction.  The play resulted in success.  Essentially, the model understands what constitutes situations in an NFL game where success and failure are likely.  However, it is conservative in predicting success when it is unsure of the play result.  Adding stronger features could possibly provide the model with the added signal it needs to increase accuracy, but I think we may have achieved the accuracy score ceiling with the data available to us (the score has not budged from 66-67% throughout extensive feature engineering).  It is also possible that the inherent noise and variance of the data in an NFL game is near impossible to encapsulate in objective features. "

    "- **Data**: 13,000+ plays from post season NFL games from years 2016-2024\n",
    "- **Features**: Engineered 70+ signals including Scheme (motion, box counts), QB traits (CPOE, aggressiveness), and Situational Context (down, distance, score, weather)\n",
    "- **Model**: XGBoost Classifier tuned for probability calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "## RESULTS\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: ~66% (state-of-the-art for public EPA models usually tops out at ~70% due to the randomness of NFL games)\n",
    "- **Key Insight**: The model is highly calibrated and conservative.  It rarely predicts >80% success unless the situation is overwhelmingly favorable to the offense\n",
    "- **Top Predictive Features**:\n",
    "  1. 'qb_blitz_grade' (what is the QB's EPA against the blitz)\n",
    "  2. 'yards_to_goal_diff' (how close to the opponent's endzone is the offense)\n",
    "  3. 'possession_seconds' (how long has this offensive possession been in seconds)\n",
    "  4. 'active_rec_epa' (what is the preceding reg season epa of the active receiving corps for this play)\n",
    "  5. 'down' (what down is it)\n",
    "  6. 'posteam_timeouts_remaining' (how many timeouts does the offense have)\n",
    "  7. 'yardline_100' (where is the ball currently on the field)\n",
    "  8. 'active_qb_epa' (what is the reg season epa of the quarterback for this play)\n",
    "  9. 'ydstogo' (how many yards to obtain a 1st down)\n",
    "  10. 'game_seconds_remaining' (how much time is remaining in the game)"
